## Multi-Secret Sharing  
Ongoing research project with [Prof. Vinod Prabhakaran](https://www.tifr.res.in/~vinodmp/).  

Multi-Secret Sharing is a problem in information-theoretic cryptography, that is similar in setting to the [multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) problem. It involves distributing a set of *shares*, such that each party learns their *secret* using the shares accessible to them, without learning any extra information about the secrets of the other parties.  

I am currently working on the analysis of 3-party multi-secret sharing schemes under specific scenarios of the problem. I look for optimal schemes, and test the optimality by evaluating the lower bounds on randomness complexity using methods described in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44381-1_12). We are also working on alternate settings of the original problem.
