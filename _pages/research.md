## Multi-Secret Sharing  
Research project with [Prof. Vinod Prabhakaran](https://www.tifr.res.in/~vinodmp/).  

Multi-Secret Sharing is a problem in information-theoretic cryptography, that is similar in setting to the [multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) problem. It involves distributing a set of *shares*, such that each party learns their *secret* using the shares accessible to them, without learning any extra information about the secrets of the other parties.  

I worked on the analysis of 3-party multi-secret sharing schemes under specific scenarios of the problem. I looked for optimal schemes, and tested the optimality by evaluating the lower bounds on randomness complexity. We extended these information-theoretic bounds to all possible scenarios of binary secrets, as well as evaluated combinatorial bounds in cases where the lower bound was loose.  

Our paper titled *"Randomness Requirements for Three-Secret Sharing"* has been accepted for [ISIT 2023](https://isit2023.org/).
