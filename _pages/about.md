I am Aayush Rajesh, a third-year undergraduate at the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/), [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science.

I am deeply interested in research in areas along the intersection of electrical engineering and computer science. More specifically, I am fascinated by the fields of [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) and [Signal Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing), as well as their applications.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books (I am an avid bibliophile). I also follow cricket, basketball, and chess, the latter of which I also play casually. Astronomy is a big hobby of mine, due to the irresistible allure of peering out into the vast expanses of the cosmos, to understand where we came from, and where we are headed.
