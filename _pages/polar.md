Course project for EE605: Error Correcting Codes, Autumn 2022  
*with Ronil Mandavia*   

Polar codes are an interesting class of modern error-correcting codes, which has a code construction provable capable of achieving [channel capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem). We conducted a comprehensive literature review about polar codes, with the aim of providing a comprehensive presentation on the material. We looked to motivate the code construction by explaining the phenomenon of _channel polarization_, before moving on to the proof of its ability to achieve capacity for a specific case. We also covered efficient encoding and decoding strategies for the code.

> *Fun Fact: The polarization phenomenon is strikingly similar to the practice of [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)!*
