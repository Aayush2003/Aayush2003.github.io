## Course Projects

1. **Polar Codes**  
_EE 605: Error Correcting Codes, Autumn 2022_  
Presented a concise talk on polar codes, as a part of the course endterm project. [Read More](/projects/polar)    

2. **Reinforcement Learning**  
_CS 747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents, Autumn 2022_  
[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/CS747-Assignments){: .btn--code}  
Programming assignments over the duration of the course. Problem statements dealt with implementing regret-minimizing bandit algorithms, formulating and solving real-world problems as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), and developing algorithms to maneuver an autonomous vehicle out of an arena with obstacles.     

3. **IIT-B RISC Processor**  
_EE 309: Microprocessors, Spring 2022_  
We designed and tested a 16-bit RISC processor in VHDL based on a given instruction set architecture (ISA). [Read More](/projects/risc)  

4. **Digital Circuit Design**  
_EE 214: Digital Circuits Lab, Autumn 2021_  
[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/EE214){: .btn--code}  
Designed various sequential and combinatorial digital circuits such as multiplexers, ALU and string detector using VHDL, and implemented these designs on a CPLD board. Also implemented a logical representation of an ATM, capable of specifying the number of smaller denominations comprising a given amount.   

5. **Lasso Game**  
_CS 101: Computer Programming and Utilization, Autumn 2020_  
[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/Lasso-Game-CS101){: .btn--code}  
Created an interactive catch-the-object game on C++ with a variety of added features.    

## Reading Projects

1. **High Energy Astronomy**  
_Summer of Science, 2021_  
[report](/files/SoS-2021-Report.pdf){: .btn--report} [slides](/files/SoS-2021-Presentation.pdf){: .btn--slides}  
Undertook a reading project on high energy astrophysics to understand the phenomena involved in the stellar life cycle. I built upon fundamentals to delve into the mathematical descriptions of the physical processes involved.    

## Miscellaneous

1. **T.O.H.F.A.**  
[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/T.O.H.F.A){: .btn--code}  
TOHFA ( तोहफ़ा _transl_. Gift), or *T*eacher *O*riented *H*elping and *F*unctioning *A*ssistant was the result of a group project in grade 12 developed with the purpose of helping teachers with their daily book-keeping tasks through an easy-to-use assistant interface.
