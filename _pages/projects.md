## Course Projects

1. **IIT-B RISC Processor**  
_EE 309: Microprocessors, Spring 2022_  
We designed and tested a 16-bit RISC processor in VHDL based on a given instruction set architecture (ISA). [Read More](/projects/risc)

2. **Digital Circuit Design**  
_EE 214: Digital Circuits Lab, Autumn 2021_  
Designed various sequential and combinatorial digital circuits such as multiplexers, ALU and string detector using VHDL, and implemented these designs on a CPLD board. Also implemented a logical representation of an ATM, capable of specifying the number of smaller denominations comprising a given amount. [[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/EE214)]

3. **Lasso Game**  
_CS 101: Computer Programming and Utilization, Autumn 2020_  
Created an interactive catch-the-object game on C++ with a variety of added features. [[code](https://github.com/Aayush2003/Lasso-Game-CS101)]

## Reading Projects

1. **High Energy Astronomy**  
_Summer of Science, 2021_  
Undertook a reading project on high energy astrophysics to understand the phenomena involved in the stellar life cycle. I built upon fundamentals to delve into the mathematical descriptions of the physical processes involved. [[report](/files/SoS-2021-Report.pdf)] [[slides](/files/SoS-2021-Presentation.pdf)]

## Miscellaneous

1. **T.O.H.F.A.**  
TOHFA (_transl_. Gift), or *T*eacher *O*riented *H*elping and *F*unctioning *A*ssistant was the result of a group project in grade 12 developed with the purpose of helping teachers with their daily book-keeping tasks through an easy-to-use assistant interface.
